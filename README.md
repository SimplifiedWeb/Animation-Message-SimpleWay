# Animation-Message-SimpleWay
So I develope a simple Animation Message Let me explain you in Simple Way
so in this simple project,
first we will discuss window.addEventListener, click Event.

window --> Global all over the webpage.
addEventlistener --> User interaction when it hover, click, keyboard keys that's.
so window.addEventListener means ---> Golobally allows you to listen the eventListner like mouseClick, keyboards Event,
page Load like load event and more.
e.target give the current value. whenever the use clicked something its gives the current click value.

so knowing this thing you caa better understand what's going within the code I've return on index.js file.


Hope this helps.
